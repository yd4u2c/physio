not be saved the moment
             *    the new request is processed.
             *  * A locking save handler (e.g. the native 'files') circumvents concurrency problems like
             *    the one above. But by saving the session before long-running things in the terminate event,
             *    we ensure the session is not blocked longer than needed.
             *  * When regenerating the session ID no locking is involved in PHPs session design. See
             *    https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=61470 for a discussion. So in this case, the session must
             *    be saved anyway before sending the headers with the new session ID. Otherwise session
             *    data could get lost again for concurrent requests with the new ID. One result could be
             *    that you get logged out after just logging in.
             *
             * This listener should be executed as one of the last listeners, so that previous listeners
             * can still operate on the open session. This prevents the overhead of restarting it.
             * Listeners after closing the session can still work with the session as usual because
             * Symfonys session implementation starts the session on demand. So writing to it after
             * it is saved will just restart it.
